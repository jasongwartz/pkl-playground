# Pkl Playground

Like the [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/) (and others), but for [Pkl](https://github.com/apple/pkl)!

**Check out the live site at: https://pkl-playground.vercel.app**

This is spiritually a project of the [Pkl open-source community](https://github.com/pkl-community), but is under my personal GitHub to remain within the Vercel free tier.

## Development

Clone the repo, then install the dependencies with `npm install`.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
